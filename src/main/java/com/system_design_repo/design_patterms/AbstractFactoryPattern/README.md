## **Abstract Factory Pattern**

### **Purpose**

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects. It allows you to produce different types of products, but the objects produced by a specific factory are guaranteed to be compatible with each other.

### **When to Use**

Use the **Abstract Factory Pattern** when:
- You need to create families of related objects that are designed to work together.
- The exact type of object to be created should not be specified until runtime.
- You want to ensure that objects from the same family are compatible.

### **Structure**

1. **Abstract Product**: Defines an interface for a family of related products.
2. **Concrete Products**: Implements the abstract product interfaces for different variations of the family.
3. **Abstract Factory**: Declares methods for creating abstract products.
4. **Concrete Factories**: Implements the abstract factory methods to create specific families of related products.

### **Benefits**
- **Ensures compatibility**: Guarantees that products created by a family are compatible with each other.
- **Provides flexibility**: Clients can swap between different families of products without changing the client code.
- **Centralizes creation logic for multiple families**: The abstract factory simplifies the creation process for related products and ensures consistency.

## **Key Differences Between Factory and Abstract Factory**

| Aspect                       | **Factory Pattern**                                | **Abstract Factory Pattern**                           |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                   | Creates a single product of a specific type.      | Creates families of related products.                  |
| **Scope**                     | A single factory creates one kind of product.      | Multiple factories create different families of products.|
| **Factory Method**            | Single method for creating a specific product.     | Multiple methods for creating related products.        |
| **Example**                   | Creates one type of object (e.g., PDF document).   | Creates multiple related objects (e.g., PDF, Word documents, and buttons).|
| **Usage**                     | Use when you need to create a single type of object. | Use when you need to create families of related objects. |
