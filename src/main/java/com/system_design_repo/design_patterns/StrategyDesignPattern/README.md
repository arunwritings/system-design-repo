## Strategy Pattern

### Overview

The **Strategy Pattern** is a **behavioral design pattern** that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern enables the algorithm to be selected at runtime depending on the context, providing flexibility and allowing the client to choose the most appropriate behavior.

### Key Concepts:
- **Strategy**: An interface or abstract class that defines a common operation for all supported algorithms.
- **Concrete Strategy**: A class that implements the strategy interface and defines a specific algorithm.
- **Context**: The class that uses the strategy and is responsible for selecting the appropriate strategy at runtime.

### Why We Need the Strategy Pattern

The **Strategy Pattern** is useful when you need to define multiple algorithms for a specific task and allow clients to choose one at runtime. Instead of using conditional logic like `if-else` or `switch`, the strategy pattern encapsulates algorithms in separate classes, improving clarity and maintainability.

### Advantages:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each algorithm is separated into its own class, promoting clear and modular code.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New strategies can be added without modifying existing code, adhering to the open/closed principle.
- **Eliminates Conditional Logic**: The strategy pattern eliminates the need for complex `if-else` or `switch` statements, making the code easier to maintain.

### When to Use the Strategy Pattern
Use the **Strategy Pattern** when:
1. You have multiple algorithms for a specific task and want to allow the client to choose one at runtime.
2. You need to avoid conditional logic like `if-else` or `switch`.
3. You need to allow algorithms to vary independently of the clients using them.

### Common Use Cases:
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort, bubble sort).
- Compression algorithms (e.g., zip, gzip).
- Payment strategies (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer).
- Route calculation (e.g., shortest path, scenic route).

### When Not to Use the Strategy Pattern
Avoid using the strategy pattern if:
1. The problem can be solved with simple conditional logic.
2. The algorithms are unlikely to change frequently.
3. The number of algorithms will remain small and fixed.

### Benefits and Drawbacks

#### Benefits:
- **Flexibility**: Allows you to switch algorithms dynamically at runtime.
- **Maintainability**: Promotes code maintainability by isolating specific algorithms in separate classes.
- **Scalability**: New strategies can be added without changing the existing code.

#### Drawbacks:
- **Increased Number of Classes**: Each new algorithm requires a new strategy class, which could lead to an increase in the number of classes.
- **Complexity**: In some cases, the pattern may introduce unnecessary complexity for simple problems.

### Conclusion

The **Strategy Pattern** allows algorithms to be chosen dynamically at runtime, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code. It helps avoid conditional logic and supports the open/closed principle. However, it may lead to increased complexity and a larger number of classes in some cases.
